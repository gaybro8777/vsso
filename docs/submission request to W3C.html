<ol>
	<li><em><a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/2020/VSSo-20201026/">VSSo: A Vehicle Signal and Attribute Ontology</a></em></li>

<p>which is referred to as "the Submission". We request the Submission be known as the <em>VSSo</em> Submission.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p><em>VSSo (or VSS ontology) is an ontology for describing automotive attributes, branches and signals (sensors and actuators). It is based on the <a href="https://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/">Vehicle Signal Specification</a> developed by the <a href="https://www.genivi.org/">GENIVI Alliance</a> and it makes use of the SSN/SOSA modeling pattern described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/">W3C Semantic Sensor Network Ontology</a> for representing the vehicule signals.</em></p>
